<h1>Support for Statistics on the Content and Use of DSpace</h1>

<h2>Generating Statistical Reports from Log Files</h2>
<p>TBS</p>

<h2>Content Statistics</h2>
<p>
The ContentStatistics class embodies a servlet for reporting simple counts of
bitstreams, items, collections, communities, and the like.  Its output is in a
machine-readable, XML-based format:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;dspace-repository-statistics date="20100420T163205Z"&gt;
  &lt;statistic name="communities"&gt;42&lt;/statistic&gt;
  &lt;statistic name="collections"&gt;172&lt;/statistic&gt;
  &lt;statistic name="items"&gt;1882&lt;/statistic&gt;
  &lt;statistic name="bitstreams"&gt;5452&lt;/statistic&gt;
  &lt;statistic name="totalBytes"&gt;5158304476&lt;/statistic&gt;
  &lt;statistic name="images"&gt;118&lt;/statistic&gt;
  &lt;statistic name="imageBytes"&gt;148091927&lt;/statistic&gt;
&lt;/dspace-repository-statistics&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Here an <em>image</em> is a bitstream in the <code>ORIGINAL</code> bundle whose MIME type
is any of the <code>image/*</code> types.  This excludes thumbnails.
</p>

<p>
Deleted and withdrawn items are excluded from all item, bitstream, and byte counts.
</p>

<h2>Usage Instrumentation</h2>
<p>
This package makes usage instrumentation (for statistics, or whatever else
you may fancy) pluggable, while avoiding any unnecessary assumptions about how
usage events may be transmitted, persisted, or processed.
</p>

<p>
At appropriate points in the processing of user actions, events may be
assembled and "fired".  What happens when an event is fired is configurable
via the PluginManager.  One must configure a plugin for the AbstractUsageEvent
class, defined in this package, to select an event processing implementation.
</p>

<p>
Three "stock" implementations are provided.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>{@link org.dspace.app.statistics.PassiveUsageEvent PassiveUsageEvent}</dt>
	<dd>absorbs events without taking action, resulting in behavior identical
		to that of DSpace before this package was added.  This is the default
		if no plugin is configured.</dd>
	<dt>{@link org.dspace.app.statistics.UsageEventTabFileLogger UsageEventTabFileLogger}</dt>
	<dd>writes event records to a file in Tab Separated Values format.</dd>
	<dt>{@link org.dspace.app.statistics.UsageEventXMLLogger UsageEventXMLLogger}</dt>
	<dd>writes event records to a file in an XML format.  Suitable mainly for
		testing.</dd>
